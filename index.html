					<h3>In Cold Blood </h3>
					<p>I liked the novel and because of it watched the movie about its author.
                        "On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues."
                        Quote from the back of the book.</p>

					<h3>Poppy</h3>
					<p>At the very edge of Dimwood Forest stood an old charred oak where, silhouetted by the moon, a great horned owl sat waiting. The owl's name was Mr. Ocax, and he looked like death himself. With his piercing gaze, he surveyed the lands he called his own, watching for the creatures he considered his subjects. Not one of them ever dared to cross his path . . . until the terrible night when two little mice went dancing in the moonlight . . .

					<h3>The Silence of the Lambs</h3>
					<p>Thomas Harris will seize you with an emotion more profound than terror.
                        Of his previous novel, Stephen King wrote, "The book simply comes at you and comes at you, finally leaving you shaken and sober and afraid on a deeper level than simple 'thrills' alone furnish." Harris' new book is his most powerful and provocative, a novel with an impact unlike any other.</p>
